                    <p>
                        Recently graduated from UCSD for cognitive science and ready to start working full-time opportunities, especially in <strong>game development</strong>. I love to create memorably playful experiences using human-centered design principles. My itch for storytelling has resulted in some <a href="./scripts.html">plays and screenplays</a> you can read.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Good writers (and designers) are interested in people, so I'd love to hear from you! <a href="mailto:jujakide@gmail.com">Email</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/Bruhstin13">Twitter</a>, and <a href="linkedin.com/in/jjkim13">LinkedIn</a> all work for me!
