                        My name's <strong>Ju</strong>stin <strong>Ja</strong>ewon <strong>Ki</strong>m~ I'm a UX <strong>de</strong>signer (that's where <strong>jujakide</strong> comes from!) and a play/screen writer on the side.
                    </h2>
                    <p>
                        Recently graduated from UCSD for cognitive science and ready to start working full-time opportunities, especially in game development. I love to create memorably playful experiences using human-centered design principles. My itch for storytelling has resulted in some plays and screenplays you can read.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Good writers (and designers) are interested in people, so I'd love to hear from you! Email, Twitter, and LinkedIn all work for me!
