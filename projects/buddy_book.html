                <h2>Context</h2>
                <p>
                    The Buddy Book is a handbook for helping K-12 refugee students in San Diego integrate into American life by giving a list of fun and helpful activities they can do together.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Made under Design For America (DFA), an organization that uses design for social innovation and good, using the DFA Process: Identify > Immerse > Reframe > Ideate > Build > Test.

                    Problems: K-12 refugee students often struggle to catch up with their peers due to trauma, interrupted educations, unfamiliarity with their new environments, etc. Any services available to assist them often rely on consistent volunteering, which makes these services wary of one-time efforts.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Our goals were to:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Help refugee students feel more at home in their new communities.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Design a reusable and customizable solution that wouldn't require maintanence.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Identify</h2>
                <p>
                    With a problem space of K-12 already selected for us, the team began searching for inequalities in the San Diego education system by following our team-lead's suggestion of looking for problems refugee students may face. We contacted some experts and local organizations to form relationships with them as community partners.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Once we became more familiar with the K-12 refugee student problem space, we generated and organized broad How Can We (HCW) statements in 6 categories as guides for Immersion.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Administration</li>
                    <li>HCW help school staff better support refugee students?</li>

                    <li>Family</li>
                    <li>HCW create a tight & informed community between parents, students and the school?</li>

                    <li>Educational Needs</li>
                    <li>HCW help educators better understand and accommodate each student’s individual needs? </li>

                    <li>HCW help refugee families integrate into and feel more comfortable in their new local culture/community?</li>

                    <li>HCW improve communication between refugees in their community? </li>
                    
                    <li>Mental Health</li>
                    <li>HCW help refugee students feel safe to open up if they need psychological support and be informed about accessible resources?</li>

                <h2>Immerse</h2>
                    <p>
                        Meeting with community partners gave us insights into already-existing solutions, such as soccer as a way to transcend the language barrier and volunteer-run tutoring programs that rely on consistent interaction between volunteer and student, which served as inspiration and influences throughout the handbook's development.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The team compiled all of our newfound knowledge to pick out key insights we found. Data was synthesized from <em>Refugee Students Needs Assmeent Report 2015 (San Diego Unified School District)</em> and various interviews.
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Family</li>
                        <li>64% respondents didn’t feel that refugee parents have a connection to school.</li>

                        <li>Educational Needs</li>
                        <li>There is no adequate system in place to assign newly immigrated students to the appropriate grade level.</li>
                        <li>San Diego Unified School District has more refugee students than any other district in CA.</li>

                        <li>Socio/Cultural</li>
                        <li>Language is the biggest barrier, as there are more than 65 different languages spoken by refugees.</li>
                        <li>56% of respondents did not feel that refugee students know how to find academic support when they need it.</li>

                        <li>Community Relations</li>
                        <li>Yalla preferred building the students' relationships to the community and supports the integration of refugee students into El Cajon.</li>

                        <li>Mental Health</li>
                        <li>72% of respondents said there is a lack of appropriate student support services for refugee students.</li>

                <p>
                    Based on our findings from the Immersion phase, our solution had to meet certain expectations that indicate its success and impact.
                </p>

                <p>
                    We all agreed that our design would be effective if:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Students gained a sense of teamwork and camaraderie.</li>
                    <li>Students were able to recognize what resources they have and where/how to find them.</li>
                    <li>Students felt more comfortable in school.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    We also knew that our designs would successfully impact the students' lives if:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>They become more sociable and successful with their studies</li>
                    <li>They are not afraid to speak up if they need help</li>
                    <li>They actively participate in their local communities</li>
                    <li>They feel like they belong</li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    The team also narrowed down and refined the HCW statements to reflect our progress. These 3 statements became our guiding questions as we progressed with the project:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>HCW help refugee families integrate into and feel more comfortable in their new local culture/community?</li>
                    <li>HCW improve communication between refugees in their community? </li>
                    <li>HCW help refugee students feel safe to open up if they need psychological support and be informed about accessible resources?</li>

            <div class="container">
                <h2>Ideate</h2>
                <p>
                    After finding the questions we wanted to answer, we began brainstorming and thought up ideas ranging from:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>A passion planner designed for either personal use or with a mentor</li>
                    <li>A program where high school students can volunteer to help out their peers with academic or social activities (like a buddy program in elementary school).</li>
                    <li>Pokemon Go-style app that allows refugee to interact with local landmarks, customs, and languages used.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Common themes found included: </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Peer Systems</li>
                    <li>Guide Books</li>
                    <li>Fun Activities</li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    We soon refined our favorite ideas that fell under the common themes through discussion and synthesis:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>A mentorship program that pairs an older refugee student with a younger refugee student. The younger one can learn from and have a friend in the older one.</li>
                    <li>A handbook that shows local landmarks and safe places to go to in San Diego.  It also teaches the basics of public transportation, conversation starters, etc.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p>
                    The team decided to make a handbook that would help older refugee students mentor their juniors by bonding together and learning more about San Diego and American culture through fun and interactive activities. Combining both ideas saved time, met our goals, and answered the refined HCW statements.

                <p>
                    One half of the team focused on making real content, while the other half I was on handled the graphic design. We started listing traits we wanted the handbook to look like and chose "Friendly" and "Welcoming".

                    Each activity was first presented with a brief introduction and then led off to a quick summary, instructions, critical thinking discussion questions, and a big picture explanation of how the activity benefits the users.

                    Tisa Pro was chosen for the body text because it's a light serif-font that's easy to read. Niveau Grotesk was used for the title and larger text due to its sharp, yet jovial nature.

                <p>
                    The color palette was inspired by an interview with Haim Saban, creator of the Power Rangers and former child refugee.

                    My experience with Illustrator made me in charge of defining the base template. I started with a sample page to gauge the balance between the fonts, colors, and shapes. Then I made a golden section spread to make an empty template for the team to use.

                    We were unfortunately unable to test the handbook due to everyone leaving. Our next steps would have been testing with our generous community partners and having follow up interviews so we could refine our solution or try another solution.

                    My first long-term project taught me design outside the classroom is unpredictable and requires time and commitment. I am grateful for experiencing real-world design work, the valuable teamwork moments, and learning about and trying to make a difference for an underrepresented community. This project showed me that social issues can be addressed by the genuine collective efforts of dedicated human beings over a period of time.
