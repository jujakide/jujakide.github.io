                    <h4>Problems</h4>
                    <li>
                        K&ndash;12 refugee students struggle educationally due to trauma, interrupted educations, unfamiliarity with new environments, etc.                        
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Any available services often rely on consistent volunteering, which makes these services wary of one-time efforts.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <ul>

                <h2>Identify</h2>
                <p>
                    With a problem space of K&ndash;12 already selected for us, the team began searching for inequalities in the San Diego education system by following our team-lead&rsquo;s suggestion of looking for problems refugee students may face. We contacted some experts and local organizations to form relationships with them as community partners.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Once we became more familiar with the K&ndash;12 refugee student problem space, we generated and organized broad How Can We (HCW) statements in 6 categories as guides for Immersion.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <h4>Family</h4>
                    <li>HCW create a tight & informed community between parents, students and the school?</li>
                </ul>

                <ul>
                    <h4>Educational Needs</h4>
                    <li>HCW help educators better understand and accommodate each student&rsquo;s individual needs? </li>
                </ul>

                <ul>
                    <h4>Socio/Cultural</h4>
                    <li>HCW help refugee families integrate into and feel more comfortable in their new local culture/community?</li>
                </ul>

                <ul>
                    <h4>Community Relations</h4>
                    <li>HCW improve communication between refugees in their community? </li>
                </ul>
                    
                <ul>
                    <h4>Mental Health</h4>
                    <li>HCW help refugee students feel safe to open up if they need psychological support and be informed about accessible resources?</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Immerse</h2>
                    <p>
                        Community partners shared already-existing solutions, such as soccer as a way to transcend the language barrier and volunteer-run tutoring programs, which influenced the handbook&rsquo;s development.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The team compiled all of our newfound knowledge from various interviews and <em><a href="https://www.sandiegounified.org/sites/default/files_link/district/files/cyt/Refugee%20Student%20Needs%20Assessment%20Report%202015%20San%20Diego%20Unified.pdf" target="_blank">Refugee Students Needs Assessment Report 2015 (San Diego Unified School District)</a></em>.
                    </p>

                    <ul>
                        <h4>Family</h4>
                        <li>64% respondents didn&rsquo;t feel that refugee parents have a connection to school.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <ul>
                        <h4>Educational Needs</h4>
                        <li>There is no adequate system in place to assign newly immigrated students to the appropriate grade level.</li>
                        <li>San Diego Unified School District has more refugee students than any other district in CA.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <ul>
                        <h4>Socio/Cultural</h4>
                        <li>Language is the biggest barrier, as there are more than 65 different languages spoken by refugees.</li>
                        <li>56% of respondents did not feel that refugee students know how to find academic support when they need it.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <ul>
                        <h4>Community Relations</h4>
                        <li>Yalla preferred building the students&rsquo; relationships to the community and supports the integration of refugee students into El Cajon.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <ul>
                        <h4>Mental Health</h4>
                        <li>72% of respondents said there is a lack of appropriate student support services for refugee students.</li>
                    </ul>

                <h2>Reframe</h2>
                <p>
                    Based on our findings from the Immersion phase, our solution had to meet certain expectations that indicate its success and impact.
                </p>

                <h4>Effectiveness</h4>
                <p>
                    We all agreed that our design would be effective if students gained a sense of teamwork and camaraderie, recognized what resources they already have and where/how to find others, and felt more comfortable in school.
                </p>

                <h4>Successful Impact</h4>
                <p>
                    We also knew that our designs would successfully impact the students&rsquo; lives if they became more sociable and successful with their studies, were not afraid to ask for help, actively participated in their community, and felt like they belong.
                </p>

                <h4>Guiding Questions</h4>
                <p>
                    The team also narrowed down and refined the HCW statements to reflect our progress. These 3 statements became our guiding questions as we progressed with the project:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>HCW</strong> help refugee families integrate into and feel more comfortable in their new local culture/community.</li>
                    <li><strong>HCW</strong> improve communication between refugees in their community?</li>
                    <li><strong>HCW</strong> help refugee students feel safe to open up if they need psychological support and be informed about accessible resources?</li>
                </ul>

                    <figcaption>Our How Can We statements, where we asked ourselves questions to better understand the context of refugee children learning in American classrooms.</figcaption>
                </figure>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>Ideate</h2>
                <p>
                    After finding the questions we wanted to answer, we brainsormed and thought up ideas including: 
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li><em>A passion planner</em> for either personal use or with a mentor.</li>
                    <li><em>A buddy program</em> where high school students can volunteer to help out their peers with academic or social activities.</li>
                    <li><em>A Pokemon Go&ndash;style app</em> that allows students to interact with local landmarks, customs, and languages used.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Refinement</h4>
                <p>
                    We soon refined our favorite ideas that fell under common themes of Peer Systems, Guide Books, and Fun Activities through discussion and synthesis:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><em>A mentorship program</em> that pairs an older refugee student with a younger refugee student. The younger one can learn from and have a friend in the older one.</li>
                    <li><em>A handbook</em> that shows local landmarks and safe places to go to in San Diego.  It also teaches the basics of public transportation, conversation starters, etc.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Synthesizing Our Options</h4>
                <p>
                    The team decided to make a handbook that would help older refugee students mentor their juniors by bonding together and learning more about San Diego and American culture through fun and interactive activities. Combining both ideas saved time, met our goals, and answered the refined HCW statements.
                </p>

                <h2>Build</h2>
                <p>
                    One half of the team focused on making real content, while the other half I was on handled the graphic design. We started listing traits we wanted the handbook to look like and chose &ldquo;Friendly&rdquo; and &ldquo;Welcoming&rdquo;. 
                </p>

                <figure>
                    <img src="../images/buddy-pics/comic.png" alt="comic book" class="zoom"/>
                    <figcaption>One inspiration. We wanted our handbook to be as accessible to even young children as this comic book.</figcaption>
                </figure>

                <p>
                    Each activity was first presented with a brief introduction and then led off to a quick summary, instructions, critical thinking discussion questions, and a big picture explanation of how the activity benefits the users.
                </p>

                <figure>
                        <img src="../images/buddy-pics/format.jpeg" alt="handbook format sketches" class="zoom"/>
                        <figcaption>Notes on how we decided to format the handbook.</figcaption>
                </figure>

                <p>            
                    Tisa Pro was chosen for the body text because it&rsquo;s a light serif font that&rsquo;s easy to read. Niveau Grotesk was used for the title and larger text due to its sharp, yet jovial nature.
                </p>

                <figure>
                    <img src="../images/buddy-pics/sample.png" alt="sample page format" class="zoom"/>
                    <figcaption>The sample page draft of the handbook. I wanted to focus on creating a base template for the team to work on.</figcaption>
                </figure>

                <p>
                    The color palette was inspired by an interview with Haim Saban, creator of the Power Rangers and former child refugee.
                </p>

                </figure>

                <p>           
                    My experience with Illustrator made me in charge of defining the base template. I started with a sample page to gauge the balance between the fonts, colors, and shapes. Then I made a golden section spread to make an empty template for the team to use. 
                </p>

                    <figcaption>The golden section spread I used for the handbook&rsquo;s layout. The color palette was consistently arranged in every content page at the top right corner to create a visual index, so the reader could keep track of which section they&rsquo;re in.</figcaption>

            <section>
                <h2>Test</h2>
                <p>
                    We were unfortunately unable to test the handbook due to everyone leaving. Our next steps would have been testing with our generous community partners and having follow up interviews so we could refine our solution or try another solution.
                </p>

                <h2>Reflection</h2>
                <p>
                    My first long-term project taught me design outside the classroom is unpredictable and requires time and commitment. I am grateful for experiencing real-world design work, the valuable teamwork moments, and learning about and trying to make a difference for an underrepresented community. This project showed me that social issues can be addressed by the genuine collective efforts of dedicated human beings over a period of time.
