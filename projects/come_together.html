                <p>
                    Potential stakeholders disliked unnecessarily long and expensive public works and believed local initiatives were more effective. In response I wrote 1 of 3 storyboards that incorporated stakeholder concerns. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    The scenario introduced Doris who helped her community collaborate to fix a pothole using our app. Our storyboards helped the team demonstrate to instructors how users may interact with our solution.

                <h2>User Flows and Wireframes</h2>

                <h4>Low-Fidelity</h4>
                <p>
                    The team prototyped variations of our solution. I mapped out and embedded into a paper prototype a set of user flows that explored a user&rsquo;s possible options. My group was inspired by Kickstarter&rsquo;s simple yet effective onboarding process and Google Map&rsquo;s display of location radii. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    By focusing on the user quickly going from point A to B, I drafted a flow that helped users efficiently sign up and create or find projects in their immediate areas.
                </p>

                <figure>
                    <!-- <img alt="kickstarter + google screens?"/> -->

                    <figcaption>The user flow I sketched that implemented the Google Maps API.</figcaption>
                </figure>

                <h4>Low-Fidelity Testing</h4>
                <p>
                    To test our flow, we had other teams use our paper prototypes. Through observation we categorized breakdowns in the prototypes and assigned severity ratings based on Nielsen&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ten-usability-heuristics/">&ldquo;Ten Usability Heuristics&rdquo;</a>. We gained information on concrete issues that affected our prototypes and extracted insights to determine changes for the next iteration.
                </p>
                
                <!-- <figure>
                    <img alt="chart of usability testing results"/>
                </figure> -->

                <h4>Lo-fi Video Demo</h4>
                <p>
                    Before wireframing our flow, our studio asked us to make a demo of our prototype's interactions and how it addresses user needs.
                </p>
                <figure>
                    <video controls width="480">
                        <source src="../video/120.mp4" type="video/mp4">
                    </video>
                </figure>

                <h4>High-Fidelity</h4>
                <p>
                    Now that we had insights from testing, we had to reiterate by implementing them into our prototype. To do so, I tuned the user flow by incorporating user feedback and finalizing the changes on the current flow into a new refined flow with digital wireframes. 
                </p>

            <section>
                <h2>Site Content</h2>
                <p>
                    After presenting the wireframes to instructors we began implementing the app. I created realistic place-holder content for the site by specifying formatting and how content should focus around social-good and written from a local citizen&rsquo;s perspective. This filler content represented Come Together&rsquo;s mission and communicated our values to potential users.

                <h2>A/B Testing</h2>
                <p>
                    We tested our web prototype by having two users from our target userbase try the site and ran an A/B experiment online. Observations led to discovering user breakdowns and Google Analytics data that helped us implement changes to the UI.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Slow user response time to find the login button led to increased button sizes for ease of navigation and finger-length accessibility.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A chi-squared test in Google Analytics supported making project images larger and adding a progress bar by rejecting our null hypothesis of both versions having the same percentage of clicks on projects.
                </p>

                <h2>Presentations</h2>
                <p>
                    At the end of the quarter we showcased our work via a 30-second elevator pitch and a poster session. I helped with writing and giving the pitch and designing the slide and poster. By pitching our civic-minded project to industry professionals and instructors, we won an award for &ldquo;Most Likely to Change the World&rdquo;.

                <h2>Ideal Next Steps</h2>
                <p>
                    Had we more time, the team would have focused on designing for larger screens for a proper responsive web experience. As it stands, only the mobile layout is properly designed for.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Further user testing on a larger scale would be another important item, since we wanted to see if multiple groups of users could come together (heh) and create activity for a public works project.
                </p>

                <h2>Reflection</h2>
                <p>
                    Come Together was a fast-paced marathon through the UX process and helped me understand the foundational concepts and experience of collaboration in a team under time constraints. I&rsquo;m thankful for the opportunity to work with both UX designers and programmers for a project that addresses real world issues.
