                <h2>Storyboard</h2>
                <p>
                    Potential stakeholders disliked unnecessarily long and expensive public works and believed local initiatives were more effective. In response I wrote 1 of 3 storyboards that incorporated stakeholder concerns. The scenario introduced Doris who helped her community collaborate to fix a pothole using our app. Our storyboards helped the team demonstrate to instructors how users may interact with our solution.

                <h2>User Flows and Wireframes</h2>

                <h3>Low-Fidelity</h3>
                <p>
                    The team prototyped variations of our solution. I mapped out and embedded into a paper prototype a set of user flows that explored a user&rsquo;s possible options. My group was inspired by Kickstarter&rsquo;s simple yet effective onboarding process and Google Map&rsquo;s display of location radii. By focusing on the user quickly going from point A to B, I drafted a flow that helped users efficiently sign up and create or find projects in their immediate areas.
                </p>

                </figure>

                <h3>Low-Fidelity Testing</h3>
                <p>
                    To test our flow, we had other teams use our paper prototypes. Through observation we categorized breakdowns in the protoypes and assigned severity ratings based on Nielsen&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ten-usability-heuristics/">&ldquo;Ten Usability Heuristics&rdquo;</a>. We gained information on concrete issues that affected our prototypes and extracted insights to determine changes for the next iteration.

                <!-- <figure>

                </figure> -->

                <h3>High-Fidelity</h3>
                <p>
                    Now that we had insights from testing, we had to reiterate by implementing them into our prototype. To do so, I tuned the user flow by incorporating user feedback and finalizing the changes on the current flow into a new refined flow with digital wireframes.

                <h2>Site Content</h2>
                <p>
                    After presenting the wireframes to instructors we began implementing the app. I created realistic place-holder content for the site by specifying formatting and how content should focus around social-good and written from a local citizen&rsquo;s perspective. This filler content represented Come Together&rsquo;s mission and communicated our values to potential users.

                <h2>A/B Testing</h2>
                <p>
                    We tested our web prototype by having two users from our target userbase try the site and ran an A/B experiment online. Observations led to discovering user breakdowns and Google Analytics data that helped us implement changes to the UI. For example, a chi-squared test using this data supported making project images larger and adding a progress bar by rejecting our null hypothesis of both versions having the same percentage of clicks on projects.

                    At the end of the quarter we showcased our work via a 30-second elevator pitch and a poster session. I helped with writing and giving the pitch and designing the slide and poster. By pitching our civic-minded project to industry professionals and instructors, we won an award for &ldquo;Most Likely to Change the World&rdquo;.

                <p>
                    Come Together was my introduction to the UX process and helped me understand the foundational concepts and experience of collaboration in a team under time constraints. I&rsquo;m thankful for the opportunity to work with both UX designers and programmers for a project that addresses real world issues.
