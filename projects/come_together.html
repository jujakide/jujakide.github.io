            <h2>Context</h2>
            <p>
                Come Together is an app for community empowerment via crowd-sourcing that addresses difficulties with fixing problems in local neighborhoods. Made for an Interaction Design class under the Crowd-Sourcing studio.

            <ul>
                <li>Role: UX and UI Designer</li>
                <li>Team Size: 3</li>
                <li><strong>Tools:</strong> Google Drawings, Google Analytics, Pen & Paper</li>
                <li><strong>Skills:</strong> Storyboarding, User Flows, Wireframing, Content Strategy, Usability Testing, A/B Testing, Public Speaking and Presenting</li>
                <li><strong>Time:</strong> Jan 2017 - Mar 2017</p></li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                    <strong>My responsibilities as UX and UI Designer included writing storyboards, mapping the user flow, designing wireframes, developing a content strategy, testing, and presenting the product.</strong>
                </p>

            <p>
                Problem: 
                Local community members often struggle to fix problems within their neighborhoods due to a lack of a strong sense of community or knowledge about passing red tape.
            </p>

            <p>
                Our solution was to:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Create an online environment that cultivates community involvement.</li>
                <li>Empower local projects within users' neighborhoods.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Storyboard</h2>
            <p>
                Potential stakeholders disliked unnecessarily long and expensive public works and believed local initiatives were more effective. In response I wrote 1 of 3 storyboards that incorporated stakeholder concerns. The scenario introduced Doris who helped her community collaborate to fix a pothole using our app. Our storyboards helped the team demonstrate to instructors how users may interact with our solution.

            <h2>User Flows and Wireframes</h2>
            <h3>Low-Fidelity</h3>
                <p>
                    The team prototyped variations of our solution. I mapped out and embedded into a paper prototype a set of user flows that explored a user's possible options. My group was inspired by Kickstarter's simple yet effective onboarding process and Google Map's display of location radii. By focusing on the user quickly going from point A to B, I drafted a flow that helped users efficiently sign up and create or find projects in their immediate areas.

                </p>
            <h3>Low-Fidelity Testing</h3>
                <p>
                    To test our flow, we had other teams use our paper prototypes. Through observation we categorized breakdowns in the protoypes and assigned severity ratings based on Nielsen's <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ten-usability-heuristics/">"Ten Usability Heuristics"</a>. We gained information on concrete issues that affected our prototypes and extracted insights to determine changes for the next iteration.

                </p>
            <h3>High-Fidelity</h3>
                <p>
                    Now that we had insights from testing, we had to reiterate by implementing them into our prototype. To do so, I tuned the user flow by incorporating user feedback and finalizing the changes on the current flow into a new refined flow with digital wireframes.

            <h2>Site Content</h2>
            <p>
                After presenting the wireframes to instructors we began implementing the app. I created realistic place-holder content for the site by specifying formatting and how content should focus around social-good and written from a local citizen's perspective. This filler content represented Come Together's mission and communicated our values to potential users.

            </p>

            <h2>Tests</h2>
            <p>
                We tested our web prototype by having two users from our target userbase try the site and ran an A/B experiment online. Observations led to discovering user breakdowns and Google Analytics data that helped us implement changes to the UI. For example, a chi-squared test using this data supported making project images larger and adding a progress bar by rejecting our null hypothesis of both versions having the same percentage of clicks on projects.

            <h2>Presentations</h2>
            <p>
                At the end of the quarter we showcased our work via a 30-second elevator pitch and a poster session. I helped with writing and giving the pitch and designing the slide and poster. By pitching our civic-minded project to industry professionals and instructors, we won an award for "Most Likely to Change the World".

            <h2>Reflection</h2>
            <p>
                Come Together was my introduction to the UX process and helped me understand the foundational concepts and experience of collaboration in a team under time constraints. I'm thankful for the opportunity to work with both UX designers and programmers for a project that addresses real world issues.
