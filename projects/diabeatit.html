                <h3>Navigation</h3>
                <p>
                    The team first began organizing the logical flow of the game&rsquo;s navigation by grouping related functions and creating objects to place within the system.
                </p>

                    <figcaption>My rough ideas of how the game should be organized</figcaption>
                </figure>

                <h3>Plot Points</h3>
                <p>
                    We plotted out the game&rsquo;s overarching narrative into plot points concurrently with its navigation. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    A typical 3-act story structure was fused with the navigation structure to ensure players would follow their avatar on their journey to learning about diabetes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When converging we decided to combine our thoughts and ideas onto a white board drawing to ensure group comprehension.

                <h2>UI: Wireframes</h2>

                <h3>Lo-fi Sketches</h3>
                <p>
                    Once we were all on the same page, we (along with someone from the Tech team) diverged to sketch lo-fi wireframes to come up with diverse ideas for presenting the navigation and story to players. 
                </p>

                <figure>

                    </figcaption>
                </figure>

                <p>
                    This strategy proved useful when we combined UI elements from each member into a collective set of wireframes that better represented the UX team&rsquo;s intentions and what the Tech team were capable of.

                <h3>Testing Paper Prototype</h3>
                <p>
                    Time constraints caused us to do quick guerilla usabilty testing using <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/responding-skepticism-small-usability-tests/">three participants</a> and specific-task based tests to elicit quick feedback for refining the UI&rsquo;s layout. 
                </p>
                <!-- <img alt="results of user testing"/> -->
                <p>
                    For example, a common issue was a lack of clear affordances with the buttons. Participants reported confusion with where they went or what their functions were. More can be seen in the <a href="../docs/user-testing-report.pdf" target="_blank">User Testing Report</a>.

                <h2>UI: Digital Collaboration</h2>

                <h3>Moodboard + Style Guide</h3>
                <p>
                    Before we began redesigning the layout in Figma, we created some quick moodboards. The first displayed inspiration for how friendly childrens&rsquo; game UI&rsquo;s should look.
                </p>

                <figure>
                    <img src="../images/diabeatit-pics/moodboard1.png" alt="moodboard #1"/>
                </figure>

                <p>
                    The second moodboard was made to reflect the game&rsquo;s tone and mood regarding teaching kids about diabetes.
                </p>

                <figure>
                    <img src="../images/diabeatit-pics/moodboard2.png" alt="moodboard #2"/>
                </figure>

                <p>
                    With the moodboards in mind, we made a styleguide to help ensure visual consistency across the game by defining the appearance of the UI elements and containers. <!--Zilla Slab was chosen for its friendly apperance. Button sizes at varying dimensions were created for different functions. The color palette was used to provide a versatile set of options for future teams should they need it.--> 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Containers in this diagram are presented with their frames removed to help the team understand how layering worked with their contents.
                </p>

                </figure>

                <h3>Digital Prototypes</h3>
                <p>
                    The UX team worked together in Figma because of its collaborative ability and perks from its free plan. I redesiged and implemented in Figma the Start Menu, Settings, Intro Dialogue, and Home screen.

                <h2>User Testing Report</h2>
                <p>
                    We compiled our findings from testing in greater detail and asked future teams to consider potential issues and understand our reasoning. I wrote everything except the &ldquo;Results & Interpretation&rdquo; section.

                <h2>Reflection</h2>
                <p>
                    Diabeatit was one of my last projects before leaving UCSD and I loved having the chance to work on games. I also learned a lot more about myself, my communication style, and leading others by going outside of my comfort zone and taking this responsibility.
