                <h3>Description</h3>
                <p>
                    Diabeatit is an educational health game tablet app aiming to teach children about diabetes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Made under UCSD Global Ties's Design For Development Lab for clients at the UCSD School of Medicine.

                <h3>Problem</h3>
            <p>
                Due to a complete overhaul by the previous team, the UX team had to build off the previous team's work while introducing new elements for current and future needs. 
            </p>
            <p>
                We also had to keep in communication with the Tech team (who were implementing the game in Unity) and Research (who were handling the knowledge behind diabetes).
            </p>
            <h3>Solutions</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>We created a mental model to help organize the game and direct game flow for players and future teams. </li>
                    
                    <li>A UI was designed to help future teams better understand the game's creative direction and start a discussion on how to make the game look and feel fun for players.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Navigation</h3>
                <p>
                    The team first began organizing the logical flow of the game's navigation by grouping related functions and creating objects to place within the system.
                </p>

                </figure>

                <h3>Plot Points</h3>
                <p>
                    We plotted out the game's overarching narrative into plot points concurrently with its navigation. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    A typical 3-act story structure was fused with the navigation structure to ensure players would follow their avatar on their journey to learning about diabetes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When converging we decided to combine our thoughts and ideas onto a white board drawing to ensure group comprehension.
                </p>

                <h2>UI: Wireframes</h2>
                <h3>Lo-fi Sketches</h3>
                <p>
                    Once we were all on the same page, we (along with someone from the Tech team) diverged to sketch lo-fi wireframes to come up with diverse ideas for presenting the navigation and story to players. 
                </p>

                </figure>
                <p>
                    This strategy proved useful when we combined UI elements from each member into a collective set of wireframes that better represented the UX team's intentions and what the Tech team were capable of.

                <h3>Testing Paper Prototype</h3>
                <p>
                    Time constraints caused us to do quick guerilla usabilty testing using <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/responding-skepticism-small-usability-tests/">three participants</a> and specific-task based tests to elicit quick feedback for refining the UI's layout. 
                </p>
                <!-- <img alt="results of user testing"/> -->
                <p>
                    For example, a common issue was a lack of clear affordances with the buttons. Participants reported confusion with where they went or what their functions were. More can be seen in the <a href="../docs/user-testing-report.pdf" target="_blank">User Testing Report</a>.
                </p>

                <h2>UI: Digital Collaboration</h2>
                <h3>Moodboard + Style Guide</h3>
                <p>
                    Before we began redesigning the layout in Figma, we created some quick moodboards. The first displayed inspiration for how friendly childrens' game UI's should look.
                </p>

                <figure>
                    <img src="../images/diabeatit-pics/moodboard1.png" alt="moodboard #1"/>
                </figure>
                
                <p>
                    The second moodboard was made to reflect the game's tone and mood regarding teaching kids about diabetes.
                </p>
                <figure>
                    <img src="../images/diabeatit-pics/moodboard2.png" alt="moodboard #2"/>
                </figure>

                <p>
                    With the moodboards in mind, we made a styleguide to help ensure visual consistency across the game by defining the appearance of the UI elements and containers. <!--Zilla Slab was chosen for its friendly apperance. Button sizes at varying dimensions were created for different functions. The color palette was used to provide a versatile set of options for future teams should they need it.-->

                <h3>Digital Prototypes</h3>
                <p>
                    The UX team worked together in Figma because of its collaborative ability and perks from its free plan. I redesiged and implemented in Figma the Start Menu, Settings, Intro Dialogue, and Home screen.

                    We compiled our findings from testing in greater detail and asked future teams to consider potential issues and understand our reasoning. I wrote everything except the "Results & Interpretation" section.

                <p>
                    Diabeatit was one of my last projects before leaving UCSD and I loved having the chance to work on games. I also learned a lot more about myself, my communication style, and leading others by going outside of my comfort zone and taking this responsibility.
