                <h2>Context</h2>
                <h3>Description</h3>
                <p>
                    FeetFit is a point of purchase (POP) shoe kiosk made for UCSD's Prototyping studio that aims to accurately measure the users' feet and quickly deliver the right shoes.
                </p>

                    <li><strong>Role:</strong> UX and Graphic Designer</li>
                    <li><strong>Team Size:</strong> 4</li>
                    <li><strong>Tools:</strong> Illustrator, Milanote, Pen and Paper</li>

                    <li><strong>Time:</strong> Jan 2019 - Mar 2019</li>
                </ul>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Prototyped a kiosk for public setting by creating persona, storyboard, wireframes, interviews, usability testing, and moodboards.</strong></li>
                    <li><strong>Designed a poster using grids, hierarchy, and adherence to style guide.</strong></li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Problem</h3>
                <p>
                    The current in-store shoe shopping experience is heavily reliant on interaction with store employees and which can place pressure on the consumer.
                </p>
                <h3>Solution</h3>
                <p>
                    FeetFit is a POP) shoe kiosk that allows shoppers to browse shoes, measure their feet, and try on pairs at their own convenience.

            <div class="container">
                <h2>Online Research</h2>
                <p>
                    The team first explored the problem space by finding common issues users complained about. They included:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Struggling to find the right fit</li>
                    <li>Lack of standard shoe sizes across different brands.</li>
                    <li>Difference in one's own feet sizes.</li>
                    <li>Return Issues</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="container">
                <h2>User Interviews</h2>
                <p>
                    We guerilla interviewed potential users and asked questions like the time they spent shoe shopping, why the bought them and where, how easy the experience was, and what it was like if they bought shoes for someone else.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="container">
                <h2>Persona</h2>
                <p>
                    We aggregated our findings from research and interviews into personas that reflected the users we each advocated for. My persona advocated for the elderly and the struggles they may face.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Our target age was 16-30 for people who weren't sure about their foot size (for reasons like differing foot sizes) and wanted to quickly find the right fit.
                </p>

            <div class="container">
                <h2>Storyboard</h2>
                <p>
                    We made storyboards to empathize and understand how users may approach and use the kiosk in certain scenarios.
                </p>

                        Mine followed an elderly user named Margaret, who has a foot condition and struggles to find the right shoes.

                <h2>Sketches</h2>
                <p>
                    With a better grasp of how users would interact with the kiosk, we sketched out thumbnails of how it would look and where the functions would be.
                </p>
                <figure>
                    <img src="../images/feetfit-pics/sketches.jpg" alt="sketches"/>
                    <figcaption>We aimed for it to have a space for the shoe, a measurement method, a digital tablet interface for browsing, and a payment method.</figcaption>

            <div class="container">
                <h2>Lo-Fi Wireframes</h2>
                <p>
                    We first mapped out a flow for the digital screen by considering user needs (measuring and finding shoes, retrieval, payment, etc.) and then approximating layouts using thumbnails before moving onto more accurately-sized paper prototypes.
                </p>
                <figure>

            <div class="container">
                <h2>Paper Prototype Testing</h2>
                <p>
                    Next we made a paper prototype using fleshed-out wireframes based on our thumbnails to test our current digital screen flow by guerilla testing with and eliciting feedback from previous interviewees.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Testing mainly showed issues with a lack of a back button, no signifier to place feet (due to it being paper and not with the full kiosk), unclear wait times, and a disconnect between user expecations and screen functions. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    These problems were solved by adding a back button, including instructions on where to place feet, showing wait times on the tablet, and clearer instructions throughout the app.
                </p>

            <div class="container">
                <h2>Moodboard</h2>
                <p>
                    I used Milonote and consulted the UI designer to make a quick moodboard for her to base a style guide on. The moodboard reflects the diverse age range and warm and friendly feeling our kiosk was supposed to portray.
                </p>
                <figure>

            <div class="container">
                <h2>Digital Prototype Testing</h2>
                <p>
                    Our UI designer created a digital prototype and we tested again. This time the main issues involved a lack of cues for payment, limited functional shoe selections, need for UI clarity (such as making buttons more noticeable), and a lack of a thank-you screen after a purchase.
                </p>
                <figure>
                    <img src="../images/feetfit-pics/size.png" alt="adobe xd screenshot"/>
                </figure>
                <p>
                    We addressed these issues in the next iteration by adding more steps to the payment process, implementing more selectable shoes, increasing color contrast, and adding a thank-you-screen upon a successful purchase.

                <h2>Cardboard Prototyping</h2>
                <p>
                    While the UI designer was designing, the rest of us were constructing the cardboard prototype using box-cutters, rulers, and tape. After forming the basic structure, door, tablet-holder and measurement device, we spray painted the base (we couldn't add on more colors due to time).

                <h2>Poster Design</h2>
                <p>
                    I made a poster for the final presentation using brand colors and high-quality stock-photos to illustrate the basic steps of the FeetFit kiosk.

                <p>
                    In the final presentation, we pitched the FeetFit kiosk by presenting our cardboard prototype, poster, and demonstration to receive feedback on our work.

                <h2>Reflection</h2>
                <p>
                    FeetFit was a particularly challenging project due to the time constraints and disagreements we had as a team, but I am grateful for the opportunity to develop my prototyping, communication, and teamwork skills.
