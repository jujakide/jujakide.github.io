                <h2>Project Summary</h2>
                <p>
                    Made as a practical application of ethnographic methods and human-centered cognitive design principles for the Cognitive Design Studio.
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <h4>Role</h4>
                    <li>As a <strong>UX Designer</strong> I actively sought out user needs and wants to translate into insights that helped inform the development of a design solution that addressed said needs and wants.</li>
                    <li>As a <strong>User Researcher</strong> I leveraged ethnographic methods in the field to interview and gather information on the project's userbase that informed essential design decisions made further down the development process.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <ul>
                    <h4>Team Size</h4>
                    <li>6</li>
                </ul>
                    
                <ul>
                    <h4>Tools</h4>
                    <li>Outreach and Research, Ethnographic Field Methods and Analysis, Google Sheets</li>
                </ul>
                    
                <ul>
                    <h4>Skills</h4>    
                    <li>UX Design, User Research<li>
                </ul>

                <ul>
                    <h4>Time</h4>
                    <li>Mar 2018 &ndash; June 2018</li>
                </ul>

                <ul>
                    <h4>Problem</h4>
                    <li>
                        Designers and developers often have differing levels of expertise in the others' field and as a result this discrepancy can lead to difficulties in communicating feedback for a project.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        How can we help facilitate the feedback process by addressing this gap in expertise?
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <ul>
                    <h4>Solution</h4>
                    <li>
                        A collaborative guidebook for communicating feedback in the feedback sessions during the period of addressing project progress at certain stages of completion and whenever an employee feels there is a communication issue on a project.
                    </li>

                <h2>Exploring and Defining the Problem Space</h2>

                <h3>Reaching Out to Potential Userbase</h3>
                <figure>
                    <img src="../images/guide-pics/meetup.png" 
                         alt="industry meetup"
                         class="zoom"/>
                    <figcaption>"Product Managers, Product Owners - are they really different?" meetup at ProductTank San Diego, where we scouted for contacts.</figcaption>
                </figure>
                <p>
                    Once the team was formed, we decided to explore our problem space and talk to potential users to define and refine the design challenge we were solving.
                </p>

                <h4>Connections</h4>
                <p>
                    We began by reaching out to professional designers and developers we knew as well as cold-calling those we didn't to broaden the userbase's scope and investigate what problems they had, how their feedback processes worked, interactions with other departments and teams, etc.
                </p>

                <h4>Industry Meetups</h4>
                <p>
                    Another avenue we took was to attend industry meetups where we could talk with developers, designers, and even secondary stakeholders. In the ProductTank meetup shown above, we managed to connect with product managers and owners and UX Designers who helped provide helpful information and interviews.
                </p>

                <p>
                    &ldquo;Feedback Incorporation Survey&rdquo; focused on collecting information on how individual designers and developers interacted with feedback in their work.
