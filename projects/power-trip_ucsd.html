                <p>
                    Power Trip UCSD is a satirical interactive fiction (IF) game about abusing your power as UCSD&rsquo;s latest chancellor.

                    <h3>Problem</h3>
                    <li>
                        How do we quickly design an engaging short IF game with limited game development experience?
                    </li>
                </ul>

                    <li>
                        A 5-min. emotionally investing IF game for UCSD students using a branching narrative structure, Twine&rsquo;s intuitive UI, and the UX process.
                    </li>
                </ul>

            <section>
                <h2>Discover</h2>

                <h3>Brainstorming</h3>
                <p>
                    Once the problem was clarified, we brainstormed questions to help guide development:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>What types of stories can we tell with Interactive Fiction?</li>
                    <li>How can we make an IF game engaging? How do we make a simple game with clicking fun?</li>
                    <li>What devices will this game be played on?</li>
                    <li>Who will most likely enjoy this game?</li>
                    <li>How long will we make this game?</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Inspiration / Competitive Analysis</h3>

                <p>
                    Next, I had the team familiarize themselves with some IF games to have a better idea of where we could go:

                <h2>Define</h2>

                <h3>Developing and Finalizing the Concept</h3>
                <p>
                    The team defined 4 main components the game consisted of:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The <strong>Scenario</strong> set the stage for players and helped the team keep track on what the game should achieve. We decided on poking fun of our school by having players roleplay as a new UCSD chancellor who needs to manage the school.</li>
                    <li>The <strong>Narrative Structure</strong> centered around story paths that reflected the struggles and memories we faced as UCSD students. 3 possible paths (the Parking, Grades, and Raccoon Sagas) gave each of my team members the opportunity to express themselves.</li>
                    <li>The <strong>Game Design</strong> was a discussion about the in-game world, actors and objects, possible actions, goals, and rules. Our game followed standard Twine format elements such as clicking on buttons/links and entering text to make choices.</li>
                    <li>The <strong>User Experience</strong> focused on gameplay length, responsiveness, and consideration of our playerbase&rsquo;s demographics. We aimed for a 5-min. HTML & CSS browser game targeting UCSD students.</li>
                </ul>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>Develop</h2>

                <h3>Team Split</h3>
                <p>
                    During the Develop phase I had the team split into Narrative and UI subteams (2 in Narrative, me and 1 person in UI) so we could focus on development faster before the deadline. 
                </p>

                <h3>Scenario</h3>
                <p>
                    The team decided on setting the game in a surreal UCSD sandbox, where players encounter raccoon uprisings or turn the chemistry department into a meth lab and create their own sub-narratives. The game introduces players as the newest UCSD chancellor and then splits into three routes.
                </p>

                <h3>Narrative</h3>
                <p>
                    The narrative would split into the Parking, Grades, and Raccoon Sagas to build a branching storyline that builds the world for players to express themselves in. Each path would interact with each other to maintain immersion of the game world and allow an engaging experience.  
                </p>

                    <img src="../images/power-pics/tree.PNG" alt="Twine tree screenshot" class="zoom"/>

                </figure>

                <h3>Game Design</h3>
                <p>
                    The core game loop was predetermined by Twine&rsquo;s capabilities and we aimed to follow conventional IF patterns such as clicking buttons/links and entering text (using SugarCube) to account for the team&rsquo;s inexperience with the genre.
                </p>

                <h3>UI Design</h3>
                <p>
                    The UI layout followed the default format specified by Sugarcube. However we developed the visual identity of the game by assigning each route a color theme and stylizing the text and links. All visual updates were made using the CSS stylesheet space in Twine.
                </p>

                <h2>Deliver</h2>

                <h3>Publishing</h3>
                <p>
                    I made the call to publish as soon as we finished the first iteration of the game due to the quarter ending and half of us graduating. We picked itch.io based on its popularity with indie devs and HTML5 support to play the game in-browser. We then shared the link with our UCSD friends for their amusement.
                </p>

                <h3>Next Steps</h3>
                <p>
                    With time, we would have conducted usability testing before shipping and reiterate on the game&rsquo;s narrative to flesh it out with more story and a lengthier storyline.

                <p>
                    While a tough project, this experience challenged me to learn from my mistakes and become a better listener and leader to my team members. I also had lots of fun making a silly game with friends and having the chance to practice game development.
